## Responsive Newsletter Form ##

Steps followed:

**Front-End**

1. Downloaded a free form design idea from the internet in .fig format.

2. I made some changes to it using Figma.

3. Reproduced the layout manually using HTML and CSS.


**Back-End**

1. Created a web server running locally and serving these files with Node.JS.

2. Installed and created a MySQL DB called "users" that receives the form data and add it to a "users" table.

3. After submitting the data, the user is redirected to a thank you page.
